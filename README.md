# Mind Field S3 E3 - The Stilwell Brain

This repo contains the neural model used in the Stilwell Brain episode of Mind Field.

I'm the scientist in the episode. This repo contains the model we ended up using (there were many 
versions as the number of participants kept changing).  The biggest challenge was making it simple
enough that the people-neurons didn't mess it up by being too smart.  It's a binary thresholded 
network with all unity weights.

Here's the trailer for the episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA5qnZUXcqo&vl=en
